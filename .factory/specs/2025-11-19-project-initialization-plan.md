I will initialize the project workspace by establishing a foundation for the codebase.

1.  [x] **Create a `.gitignore` file**: I will add a comprehensive `.gitignore` suitable for general development (covering OS files, editors, etc.).
2.  [x] **Determine Tech Stack**: I will pause to ask you which technology stack you prefer for 'pnb-srms' (e.g., **Python/FastAPI**, **Node.js/Express**, **React**, etc.), as the environment supports both Python and Node.js.
3.  [x] **Scaffold Project Structure**: Based on your choice, I will:
    *   Initialize the package manager (npm init or pip/poetry).
    *   Create the directory structure (src, tests, docs).
    *   Set up linting and formatting configurations (ESLint/Prettier or Ruff/Black).
4.  [x] **Update README.md**: I will update the README with the chosen stack and setup instructions.
